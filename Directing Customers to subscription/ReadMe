Directing customers to subscription through app behaviour analysis

Business challenge
- Working for a fintech company that wants to provide its customers with a paid mobile app subsciption that will allow them to track all of their finaces in one place. To attract customers, the company releases a free version of their app with some of the main features unlocked.
- The company has tasked us to identify which users will most likely NOT enroll in the paid product, so that additional offers can be given to them. Because of the costs of these offers, the company does not want to offer them to everybody, especially customers who were going to enroll anyways.

Data -
- By working for the company, we have access to each customer's app behavior data. This data allows us to see the date and time of app installation, as well as the features the users engaged with withing the app. App behavior is characterized as the list of app screens the looked at, and whether the user played the financial mini-games available.
- The app usage data is only from the user's first day in the app. This limitation exists because users can enjoy a 24-hour free trial of the premium features, and the company wants to target them with new offers shortly after the trial is over.
